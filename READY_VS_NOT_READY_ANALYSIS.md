## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Status Column Not Mapped**
**Before:**
```python
column_mapping = {
    # ... Status was missing!
}
```

**After:**
```python
column_mapping = {
    'Status': 'status'  # ✅ Now mapped
}
```

### **Problem 2: "in turn" Not Recognized**
**Before:**
```python
if status in ["currently work", "started", "in progress"]:  # ❌ Missing "in turn"
```

**After:**
```python
if status in ["in turn", "currently work", "started", "in progress"]:  # ✅ Added
```

---

## 📊 **Ready vs Not Ready Logic**

### **Ready:**
```python
status.lower().strip() == "ready"
```
- Excel has: `"ready "` (with trailing space)
- After strip: `"ready"` ✅ MATCHES

### **In Turn:**
```python
status.lower().strip() in ["in turn", "currently work", "started", "in progress"]
```
- Excel has: `"in turn"`
- After strip: `"in turn"` ✅ MATCHES

### **Not Ready:**
```python
# Everything else (default)
```
- Excel has: `"not ready"`, empty, or any other value
- Result: `"Not Ready"` ✅
