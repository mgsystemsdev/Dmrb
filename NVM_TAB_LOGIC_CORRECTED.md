# ✅ NVM Tab Logic - CORRECTED

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Now matches business requirements

---

## 🎯 **Correct Business Logic (As Clarified)**

### **Tab Definitions:**

| Tab | Shows | NVM Statuses | Logic |
|-----|-------|--------------|-------|
| **📢 Notice** | Units still occupied, tenant gave notice | `NOTICE` + `NOTICE + SMI` | Contains 'notice' in status |
| **🔴 Vacant** | Units that are empty | `VACANT` + `SMI` | Status = vacant or smi |
| **📦 Moving** | Units that recently moved in (past 72h) | `MOVE IN` | Move-in date ≤ today AND ≥ today - 72h |

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Moving Tab - COMPLETELY REVERSED**

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Showed units ABOUT TO move in (future)
next_72h = now + timedelta(hours=72)
moving = units_df[(move_in_dates > now) & (move_in_dates <= next_72h)]
```
❌ This showed: "Units moving in WITHIN NEXT 72 hours"

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Shows units that ALREADY moved in (past)
past_72h = now - timedelta(hours=72)
moving = units_df[(move_in_dates <= now) & (move_in_dates >= past_72h)]
```
✅ This shows: "Units that moved in WITHIN PAST 72 hours"

## 📊 **Current Data Breakdown**

Based on your actual DMRB data (21 units total):

```
NVM Status Distribution:
- SMI:           15 units (vacant, move-in scheduled)
- VACANT:         5 units (vacant, no move-in)
- NOTICE + SMI:   1 unit  (occupied, notice given, next tenant booked)
- NOTICE:         0 units (occupied, notice given, no next tenant)
- MOVE IN:        0 units (recently moved in)
```

### **Tab Results:**

| Tab | Count | Breakdown |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **📢 Notice** | 1 unit | 1 NOTICE + SMI |
| **🔴 Vacant** | 20 units | 15 SMI + 5 VACANT |
| **📦 Moving** | 0 units | No recent move-ins |

**Total:** 21 units ✅

## 🔍 **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Unit Just Moved In**
```
Unit: 210
Move-Out: 10/15/25 (past)
Move-In:  10/25/25 (yesterday)
Today:    10/26/25

NVM Status: "MOVE IN"
Appears in: 📦 Moving tab (moved in 24 hours ago)
```

### **Scenario 2: Vacant Unit with Future Move-In**
```
Unit: 305
Move-Out: 10/20/25 (past - unit is empty)
Move-In:  10/29/25 (3 days from now)
Today:    10/26/25

NVM Status: "SMI"
Appears in: 🔴 Vacant tab
NOT in:     📦 Moving tab (hasn't moved in yet)
```

### **Scenario 3: Occupied with Notice**
```
Unit: 150
Move-Out: 10/30/25 (future - still occupied)
Move-In:  11/02/25 (future - next tenant scheduled)
Today:    10/26/25

NVM Status: "NOTICE + SMI"
Appears in: 📢 Notice tab
```

### **Scenario 4: Moved In Last Week**
```
Unit: 420
Move-Out: 10/10/25 (past)
Move-In:  10/18/25 (8 days ago - more than 72h)
Today:    10/26/25

NVM Status: "MOVE IN"
Appears in: (None - moved in too long ago)
NOT in:     📦 Moving tab (moved in > 72 hours ago)
```

## 📋 **Complete Filter Logic**

### **Notice Tab**
```python
nvm_norm = units_df['nvm'].fillna('').astype(str).str.lower()
notice = units_df[nvm_norm.str.contains('notice', na=False)]
```
**Catches:**
- `"NOTICE"` → `"notice"` → contains 'notice' ✅
- `"NOTICE + SMI"` → `"notice + smi"` → contains 'notice' ✅

---

### **Vacant Tab**
```python
nvm_norm = units_df['nvm'].fillna('').astype(str).str.lower()
vacant = units_df[nvm_norm.isin(['vacant', 'smi'])]
```
**Catches:**
- `"VACANT"` → `"vacant"` → in list ✅
- `"SMI"` → `"smi"` → in list ✅

---

### **Moving Tab**
```python
move_in_dates = pd.to_datetime(units_df['move_in'], errors='coerce')
now = datetime.now()
past_72h = now - timedelta(hours=72)
moving = units_df[(move_in_dates <= now) & (move_in_dates >= past_72h)]
```
**Catches:**
- Units where: `today - 72 hours ≤ move_in_date ≤ today`
- Typically shows units with `"MOVE IN"` status

---

## 🎯 **Business Meaning**

### **Notice Tab** = "Planning"
Units where tenant gave notice. You're planning for future vacancy.
- **Status:** Still occupied
- **Action:** Coordinate move-out, prepare marketing

### **Vacant Tab** = "Available"  
Units that are currently empty (regardless of future move-in).
- **Status:** Vacant now
- **Action:** Make-ready work, show to prospects

### **Moving Tab** = "Just Moved In"
Units where tenant recently moved in (within last 3 days).
- **Status:** Newly occupied
- **Action:** Follow-up calls, welcome packet, check-in

## ✅ **Verification**

Current data shows correct distribution:

```
✅ Notice:  1 unit  (1 NOTICE + SMI)
✅ Vacant: 20 units (15 SMI + 5 VACANT)
✅ Moving:  0 units (no recent move-ins)
───────────────────
   Total: 21 units
```

**All tabs now show correct data based on computed NVM status!**

## 📁 **Files Modified**

✅ [pages/2_🏢_Units.py](file:///Users/miguelgonzalez/Documents/ActiveProjects/DMRB/pages/2_🏢_Units.py)
- Lines 182-188: Moving tab logic completely reversed
- Now shows PAST move-ins (within 72h) instead of FUTURE move-ins

---

## 🚀 **Result**

**Before:**
- Notice: 1 unit ✅
- Vacant: 20 units ✅
- Moving: 2 units ❌ (showing future move-ins - WRONG)

**After:**
- Notice: 1 unit ✅
- Vacant: 20 units ✅
- Moving: 0 units ✅ (showing past move-ins - CORRECT)

**All tabs now follow correct business logic!**
